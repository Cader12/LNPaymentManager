# LNPaymentManager
A Lightning Network Payments manager for Unity3d


# Micropayments for games and multi-media
The development of the Lightning Network has made it possible to accept micropayments (a few pence or less) for content on the web. 
This project allows your Unity3d games to accept money over the internet. This can be used for making phyiscal arcade machines and online arcades - and probably a whole lot more stuff I haven't thought of.


This project is WIP
